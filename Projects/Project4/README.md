# Project 4 

For this project, you'll need access to a public repo.  I'm going to guess that your class repo may not be in a state where it should be made public (remember those Discord API keys?), so in Pilot you will find a new invite link to a public repo for this course.  Completion of each milestone **by the date specificied for the milestone** will get you 1 pt of extra credit per milestone met.  To qualify, you must submit your project to the Dropbox for Project 4 in Pilot.

## Setup:
- Create public repo per link in Pilot
- Clone repo to your working environment (you should not need to use EC2 instances).
- Install [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) 
- Maybe: Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Part 1:  Milestone due 4/9
- Setup public repo via link in Pilot
- Dockerize your website and test locally
    - https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-09/docker-cheat-sheet.pdf
    - Your website is in reference to last project, where you put an `index.html` page on a server running `apache2`
        - As per before, a template html page is posted here in the project folder [index.html](index.html) 
- Add site content & Dockerfile to repo

## Part 2: Milestone due 4/16
- Set up with AWS CodeBuild, have return status be used of whether of not Dockerfile could be built.
- TODO: Add milestone deliverables

## Part 3: Milestone due 4/23
- If success, get AWS AMI credentials (GitHub Secrets), upload container to ECR
- Update ECS to use new container
- TODO: Add milestone deliverables

## Extra Credit:
- Dockerize your python bot
    - Will require use of GitHub Secrets to protect the API key
    - This guide has a parallel example with some things to consider
